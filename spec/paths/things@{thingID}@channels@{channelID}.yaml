  description: >
    This endpoint returns data for an individual Channel belonging to a Thing
    indexed by Thingful. It allows clients to either request the last indexed
    snapshot of the channel, or historical data for the channel for a specified
    time interval.


    When requesting historical data the maximum time interval that can be
    requested is currently 10 days though this value is liable to change at any
    time. We return all available observations for the given time interval.


    Clients are also able to request that Thingful attempt to go and fetch the
    latest data for a channel by setting the `refresh` parameter to true.
