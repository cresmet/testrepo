      The type of transaction requested. 

      You should always include the type within your API request.

      This supports a limited subset of Transaction types.  To refund or void,
      use the refund endpoint.

      To `capture` use the `sale` endpoint.  It will capture if there are any
      eligible

      transactions of type `authorize` that can be captured.
    type: string
    enum:
      - sale
      - authorize
      - credit
  amount:
    description: >
      The transaction amount.  Use `0` for a zero dollar verification. This is
      important if 

      you want to authorize a payment instrument before giving access to a free
      trial, for example.

  invoiceIds:
    description: >
      The array of invoice identifiers.  It's important to note that the
      transaction

      amount can be more or less than the combined invoice amounts.  If the
      transaction

      is a type `sale` and it is `approved` it will be applied to these invoices
      in

      the order of the first issued invoice to the most recently issued
      invoice.  If

      there are enough funds to fully pay an invoice, the invoice status will be
      marked

      as paid.

  notificationUrl:
    description: >
      The URL where a server-to-server notification request type `POST` with an
      empty body will be sent

      when the transaction's result is finalized. Do not trust the notification;

      follow with a `GET` request to confirm the result of the transaction. 
      Please respond with a `2xx`

      HTTP status code, or we will reattempt the request again.
