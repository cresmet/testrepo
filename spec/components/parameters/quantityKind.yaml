name: channel.quantityKind
in: query
description: >
  This parameter is used to search for channels that measure a specific quantity
  kind known to Thingful. The value of this field must either be a full URL
  referencing a quantiy kind defined in one of the ontologies imported by
  Thingful, or it can be a JSON-LD expandable property, i.e.
  `m3-lite:Temperature`.


  When this parameter is requested at the Thing level it returns Things where at
  least one channel measures this quantity kind, but all other channels are
  returned. When used on the Channel level it only returns channels that measure
  this quantity kind.


  The complete list of available quantity kinds can be found via our ontology
  explorer.
