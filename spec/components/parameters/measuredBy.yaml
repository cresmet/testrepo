name: channel.measuredBy
in: query
description: >
  This parameter is used to search for Channels measured by the sensor type
  given as the value of this parameter. The value of this field must either be a
  full URL referencing a quantiy kind defined in one of the ontologies imported
  by Thingful, or it can be a JSON-LD expandable property, e.g.
  `m3-lite:Thermometer` or `m3-lite:SoilHumiditySensor`


  When this parameter is requested at the Thing level it returns Things where at
  least one channel was measured by this sensor type, but all other channels are
  returned. When used on the Channel level it only returns channels that were
  measured by this sensor type.


  The complete list of available sensor types can be found via our ontology
  explorer.
