  This parameter is used to specify the end point of a time interval for which
  the client wishes to obtain data. It is expressed as an RFC3339 timestamp.


  The maximum range that clients can currently request data for is 10 days
  though this value is liable to change at any time.


  If a client requests an interval greater than the currently defined maximum we
  return a 400 error response to the client with an error message detailing the
  problem.
