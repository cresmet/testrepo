name: channel.unit
in: query
description: >
  This parameter is used to search for channels that are measured in a specific
  unit. The value of this field must be either a full URL referencing a unit
  defined in one of the ontologies Thingful imports, or it can be expressed as a
  JSON-LD expandable property, i.e. `m3-lite:DegreeCelsius`


  When this parameter is requested at the Thing level it returns Things where at
  least one channel has this unit, but all other channels are returned. When
  used on the Channel level it only returns channels that have this unit.


  A complete list of available units can be found via our ontology explorer.
