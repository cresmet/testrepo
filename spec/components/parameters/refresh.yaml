  Boolean flag indicating whether or not the client desires Thingful to go and
  try and retrieve the latest value from the upstream data provider, or just to
  return the last indexed value currently stored in Thingful's database.


  It is an error to set `refresh` to true if the client has supplied either of
  the historical time parameters, i.e. `from` or `to`.
