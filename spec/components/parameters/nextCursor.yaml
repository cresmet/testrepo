description: >
  For all result sets for which we can paginate through, this parameter is used
  to request the next page of results form within the complete result set.
  Clients should not assume they can calculate the value of this parameter,
  instead they should use the value for this parameter as supplied from the
  server back to the client in the form of the `links` property on all paginated
  result sets.
