name: X-Correlation-Id

description: >
  Header that holds an identifier which a client can choose to send in order to
  aid in debugging failing requests. When this request header is present it will
  be attached to incoming request, and this value will be tagged onto all log
  messages generated by this specific request. Finally the same identifier will
  be returned to the client via the same `X-Correlation-Id` header. If this
  header is not sent by the client, the server will return a random internally
  generated identifier.
